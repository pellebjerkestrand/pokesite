# Client Files

Files in this directory are:

- Only for the client

Either for use as entry points or shared modules.

## Entry Points

Files that match `*.entry.ts` are used as entry points when building and will have their own outfiles in the client manifest.

## Shared Modules

Files that don't match `*.entry.ts` must be modules that can be shared.
